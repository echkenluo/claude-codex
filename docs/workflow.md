# Pipeline Workflow

## Starting a New Task

1. Create `.task/user-request.txt` with your request
2. Set state: `./scripts/state-manager.sh set plan_drafting ""`
3. Run: `./scripts/orchestrator.sh`

## Execution Modes

### Interactive Mode (Default)
```bash
./scripts/orchestrator.sh
```
- Sets `CLAUDE_INTERACTIVE=1` environment variable
- Claude tasks output prompts and exit - Claude Code executes them directly
- After completing a task, run `./scripts/orchestrator.sh` again to continue
- Codex tasks still spawn subprocesses (for schema enforcement)
- Non-blocking: orchestrator exits after outputting each Claude task

### Headless Mode
```bash
./scripts/orchestrator.sh headless
```
- Spawns Claude and Codex as separate subprocesses
- Each subprocess runs with its model from `pipeline.config.json`
- Fully autonomous operation

---

The orchestrator will:
1. Read `.task/user-request.txt`
2. Run Claude to create initial plan → `.task/plan.json`
3. Transition to `plan_refining`
4. Claude refines plan → `.task/plan-refined.json`
5. Codex reviews → `.task/plan-review.json`
6. Loop until approved, then auto-convert to task
7. Claude implements → `.task/impl-result.json`
8. Codex reviews code → `.task/review-result.json`
9. Loop until approved
10. Complete

---

## Phase 1: Planning (Before Any Code)

### Claude (Plan Creator)
1. Read user request from `.task/user-request.txt`
2. Create initial plan in `.task/plan.json`

### Claude (Plan Refiner)
1. Read `.task/plan.json`
2. Analyze feasibility and clarity
3. Refine requirements, add technical details
4. Identify potential challenges
5. Write refined plan to `.task/plan-refined.json`

### Codex (Plan Reviewer)
1. Read `.task/plan-refined.json`
2. Review for:
   - Completeness (are all requirements clear?)
   - Feasibility (can this be implemented as described?)
   - Potential issues (security, performance, complexity)
   - Over-engineering risks
3. Write review to `.task/plan-review.json`
4. If `needs_changes`: Claude refines again (loop)
5. If `approved`: Proceed to implementation

### Plan Review Loop (Strict Loop-Until-Pass)
```
plan_drafting -> plan_refining -> plan_reviewing ->
                       ^                 |
                       +-- needs changes +
                                         |
                                   approved -> implementing
```

---

## Phase 2: Implementation (After Plan Approved)

### Claude (Coder)
1. Read `.task/current-task.json`
2. Read `docs/standards.md`
3. Implement following standards
4. Write output to `.task/impl-result.json`

### Codex (Code Reviewer)
1. Read `.task/impl-result.json`
2. Read `docs/standards.md`
3. Check against review checklist
4. Write output to `.task/review-result.json`

### Code Review Loop (Strict Loop-Until-Pass)
```
implementing -> reviewing -> complete
     ^              |
     +-- fixing <---+ (needs changes)
```

## State Machine

### States
`idle`, `plan_drafting`, `plan_refining`, `plan_reviewing`, `implementing`, `reviewing`, `fixing`, `complete`, `committing`, `error`, `needs_user_input`

### Full Flow
```
idle -> plan_drafting -> plan_refining -> plan_reviewing ->
                               ^                  |
                               +-- needs changes -+

## Orchestrator Safety Features

### Atomic Locking

The orchestrator uses PID-based locking to prevent concurrent execution:

- Lock file: `.task/.orchestrator.lock`
- Contains PID of running orchestrator
- Stale locks (dead PID) are automatically cleaned up
- Both `interactive`/`headless` and `reset` commands require the lock

```bash
# If you see "Another orchestrator is running" but it's stale:
rm .task/.orchestrator.lock
```

### Dry-Run Validation

Validate setup before running:

```bash
./scripts/validate-config.sh  # Strict config validation
./scripts/orchestrator.sh dry-run
```

Checks:
- `.task/` directory exists
- `state.json` valid (or will be created)
- `pipeline.config.json` valid
- Required scripts executable
- Required docs exist
- `.task` in `.gitignore`
- CLI tools available

### Phase-Aware Recovery

The recovery tool respects which phase failed:

- Errors in `plan_drafting` → retry from `plan_drafting` (re-creates plan from user-request.txt)
- Errors in `plan_refining`/`plan_reviewing` → retry from `plan_refining`
- Errors in `implementing`/`reviewing`/`fixing` → retry from `implementing`

```bash
# Interactive recovery
./scripts/recover.sh

# Check previous state
cat .task/state.json | jq '.previous_state'
```

### Local Config Overrides

Create `pipeline.config.local.json` for local overrides (gitignored):

```json
{
  "autonomy": {
    "planReviewLoopLimit": 15,
    "codeReviewLoopLimit": 20
  }
}
```
